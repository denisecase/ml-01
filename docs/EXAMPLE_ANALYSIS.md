# Overall Performance Evaluation

| Metric | Value | Min         | Max      | Meaning                                                                                          |
| ------ | ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| R^2     | 0.46  | 0 (worst)   | 1 (best) | The model explains 46% of the variance in the target variable — not great, but not terrible.     |
| MAE    | 0.62  | 0 (perfect) | ∞        | On average, predictions are 0.62 units off — moderate accuracy.                                  |
| RMSE   | 0.84  | 0 (perfect) | ∞        | Typical prediction error is 0.84 units — slightly worse than MAE, indicating some larger errors. |


## Summary

An R^2 of 0.46 suggests that the model captures some of the underlying pattern, but there’s significant unexplained variance.

The difference between MAE (0.62) and RMSE (0.84) suggests that the model makes some larger errors — RMSE penalizes these more.

## Next Steps

- Try adding more features or transforming existing ones.
- Consider regularization (e.g., Ridge or Lasso) to reduce overfitting or underfitting.
- Check for outliers that might be inflating RMSE.
- Try more complex models like tree-based models or ensemble methods.
